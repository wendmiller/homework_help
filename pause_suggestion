To get it to pause, you could add a "data-still" attribute to each image you are building at line 54.  Add something like this at line 60:

comedyImage.attr("data-still", results[i].images.fixed_height_still.url);

Then what action is supposed to control the pause?  If you just want to click on the gif to pause it, you could write a script like this:

$("div").on("click", "img", function() {
  console.log('now pause!');
  $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr('data-still'));
});

Of course, if you wanted to then unpause, you could add the animated state as "data-animate" at line 60 as well. 
comedyImage.attr("data-animate", results[i].images.fixed_height.url);

And add an attribute for "data-state" that you can set to whatever it currently is: animate or still.  
comedyImage.attr("data-state", 'animate');

And then that new script would just need to check what the current state is in an if/else.
